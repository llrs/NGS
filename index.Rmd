# Steps

## Ductular reaction signature

Obtain the ductular reaction signature the top 2000 genes differentially genes

## Alcoholic liver disease signature

Obtain the alcoholic liver disease signature of the progression of the disease the top 2000 differentially expressed genes.

## Networks
Use [WGCNA](https://labs.genetics.ucla.edu/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA/) to build the co-expressed genes of the alcoholic liver disease. And test the enrichment in the modules with genes differentially expressed genes of the ductular reaction.

## BioCor

Test if [BioCor](https://github.com/llrs/BioCor) works better finding, and grouping genes.
